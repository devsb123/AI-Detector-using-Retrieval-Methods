For example, the cost of a single space mission could fund numerous social programs or infrastructure projects that directly improve the quality of life for millions of people. Prioritizing Earth-based issues ensures that governments meet their primary responsibility: serving their citizens and improving societal well-being. Moreover, space exploration is often driven by geopolitical competition rather than genuine scientific curiosity, leading to wasteful spending and duplication of efforts. Instead of focusing on space, governments could invest in sustainable technologies and environmental conservation to address climate change, which poses a more immediate threat to humanity. While space exploration may offer long-term benefits, it is a luxury that many nations cannot afford, especially developing countries struggling with basic needs. Redirecting resources toward solving Earth’s problems would create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

Space exploration should absolutely continue to be a priority for governments because it drives technological innovation and economic growth. The pursuit of space has historically led to breakthroughs that benefit society as a whole—think of satellite technology, which powers global communication, weather forecasting, and GPS systems.
